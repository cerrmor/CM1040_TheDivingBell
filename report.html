                <h2>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my large Coursework report. The website I built is about the activity of scuba diving. The essential story being told, is how amazing Scuba Diving is and the different ways that the sport can be accessed. From either recreational to an occupational standpoint. I chose a hierarchical or tree structure to implement in designing my website.</p>
            </div>

        <div id = "questions">
            <div class = "answer">
                <h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website: These could be guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</h2>
                <p>In a past life I pursued a career in commercial diving and have always enjoyed exploring the mysteries of this hidden environment that is not so easy to access. The passion I have for this sport served as an inspiration for the narrative of the website. Diving is an activity like no other. My desire to share experiences, inspired me to try and generate excitement and knowledge for people. It is my hope that this excitement would help people to become interested in discovering more about this sport or pursuing it as a career. Finally, I was also inspired by other diving websites to try and highlight some of the most amazing dive sites across the globe.</p>

            <div class = "answer">
                <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
                <p>3 ways my site is accessible; I have included well described alt tags for the images and videos used in my website. For people more prone to seizures I have minimised strobing or flashing effects on the website. Finally, the videos I have included have a way to activate or include subtitles for the hard of hearing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "answer">
                <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</h2>
                <p>3 ways I have considered usability; The website changes size and spacing for use on different technologies like a mobile, tablet, or a desktop. I used common design placements for elements in the page. For instance, I placed the logo at the top left of the webpage and the horizontal main menu navigation, was placed at the top of each page. Finally, to make the information more accessible, I used small paragraphs and clear headings to make the content legible and scannable. For faster user navigation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "answer">
                <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and discribe how you did that: (ie what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</h2>
                <p>I wanted to figure out how to build an image carousel. To begin with I used “w3schools” embedded search engine, to look up their information on slideshows. I then took the example code from “w3schools” and embedded it into my website, to test its functionality and see if it would work. Once I had it working, I modified the code to be able to run 3 separate image carousels from the same script call.</p>
                <p>While exploring the “w3schools” reference documentation, I discovered the lightbox element. I wanted to incorporate it into my webpage because I felt it would enhance my images. However, the example code on “w3schools” originally only worked for one set of images. I modified the code example to allow several lightboxes to function on the page.</p>
                <p>Finally, I wanted to include some videos in my website. I looked up the “w3schools” reference documentation on embedding “YouTube” videos. From here I had to get creative, because I wanted the video to resize dynamically with the page. I discovered that if I wrapped the video element in a div container I could dynamically size the video.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "answer">
                <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time.</h2>
                <p>I felt the dynamic resizing of the website for different media system (ex. mobile/desktop) worked really well. It kept the page consistent and symmetric no matter the size of the device or page. Which made for reliably enjoyable experience. Another aspect of my site that worked well was the lightbox images. It was really enjoyable to see an interesting image and be able to click it, to have it expand to a larger viewable size.</p>

        <div id = "resourcesUsed">
            <h2>What resources were used when creating your work</h2>
            <div class="resourceContent">
                <p>To build my website I exclusively use “w3schools.com” it was an excellent resource for making my website responsive and had many examples of code that proved useful in building my more advance features. For example, I used the “w3schools” code example for building a light box gallery. I then modified and extended the code to allow multiple instances of the gallery to run off the same script file. I also did this with the “w3schools” carousel code example. Finally starting from “w3school” text box example I attempted to create a messenger board that could be posted to.</p>
                <p>Please find below documentation produced in the process of creating my website. As well the exaustive list of my referances and citations for media/content used in the construction of this site that was not my own work.</p>
