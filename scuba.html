                    <h2>How long has scuba been around?</h2>
                    <p>The first full time SCUBA system was invented in 1825 by William James an English man, however the air belt only stored 450 psi of air and it is not known if this system was actually used for diving.</p>
                    <p>Over the next 195 years to modern day, diving equipment has been steadily improving. Both in length of time one can stay underwater and simplicity of gear. But it wasnâ€™t until 1942 when Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Emile Gagnan invented the aqua lung that we saw the now classic image of a scuba diver appear.</p>

                        <li><em>Second</em> never go scuba diving alone! Almost every incident of a diver losing their life, or getting seriously injured occurred when the diver was by themselves and without help.</li>
                        <li><em>Third</em> find out the possible hazards from an experienced guide before diving in a new area.</li>
                        <li><em>Fourth</em> make sure your equipment is well serviced and/or sourced from a reputable company.</li>
                        <li><em>Fifth</em> test your gear before you get in the water. it is life support equipment and it just has to work.</li>

                    <h3>1. British Virgin Islands</h3>
                    <p>Most of the diving in this region is less then 80 feet or 26 meters deep. Meaning the risk of going to deep is all but eliminated. The coast line is also quite sheltered so not much for surge currents or other such hazards. Finally, there are several wrecks and reefs that can be safely explored making this a great place to begin.</p>
