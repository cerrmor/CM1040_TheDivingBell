                <h2>What is a Commercial Diver you may ask?</h2>
                <p>Commercial diver stands for a diver who works in an industrial setting. But more than that, a Commercial diver is someone who is not afraid of hard work, who doesnâ€™t like to cut corners, especially when it comes to safety, someone who takes pride in what they do, and most importantly is a team player!</p>

                <h2>How is Commercial Diving different from scuba?</h2>
                <p>Fundamentally Commercial Diving and Scuba Diving are very similar in that they both take place underwater. However, the two activities begin to show their differences right away. Almost all commercial diving uses surface supplied air delivered, by a supply line called the umbilical. This means divers can stay underwater longer and go deeper then with classic scuba diving. Another difference is that the diver has two-way communication with the surface at all times. finally, what is most likely the biggest difference is, a commercial diver can do something called saturation diving. Saturation diving is the process, where a diver is pressurised in a hyperbaric chamber to the depth of water that the work needs to be completed at. The diver then stays at that pressure until the job is done or their work rotation is done.</p>

            <h2>Is Commercial Diving for Me?</h2>
            <p>Commercial diving is an amazing field of work to pursue. However, it is not something that everyone can do. For instance, it can be very physically demanding and is likely to keep you away from friends and family, for very long periods of time. That being said there is not many other jobs quite like it and is a worthwhile pursuit. This video list's some of the biggest things to consider before starting down this path.</p>

                <h2>How do I become a Commercial Diver?</h2>
                <p>There are two methods to becoming a commercial diver. The first and arguably the easiest method is to attend a collage like these recognised by the Diver Certification Board of Canada.</p>

                <p>While the collages are an excellent way to learn the necessary skills, they are not the only way. The second route is to progress through the different dive certifications on an individual basis. Starting with a basic recreational open water certification. However, this can be a very slow and costly route.</p>
